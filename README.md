## 💡 What is MamiHealth?

**MamiHealth** is an AI-powered nutrition companion designed for people managing chronic diseases, weight loss goals, or unhealthy eating habits due to busy lifestyles.

It turns a simple daily habit — taking a photo before meals — into a powerful health decision-making moment, with personalized food suggestions based on user profiles, health data, and medical risks.

Unlike calorie-counting apps, MamiHealth offers warm, empathetic, and behavior-friendly AI support that meets users where they are.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 📸 **Pre-meal photo recognition**  
  Automatically analyzes your food composition using AI image models.

- 🩺 **Health-aware dietary advice**  
  Tailored suggestions based on chronic conditions (diabetes, gout, hypertension, etc.)

- 💬 **“Mami AI” Companion**  
  A virtual, warm, supportive guide — not a cold data bot.

- 🧠 **Long-term health data archiving**  
  Tracks trends, behaviors, and generates quarterly health summaries.

- 🔁 **Gentle behavior nudging**  
  Encourages sustainable healthy habits through micro-interactions, not punishment.
